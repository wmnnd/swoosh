# Contributing to Swoosh

Thanks for thinking about contributing to Swoosh.  Please review this document first and also take a look at our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), to help us keep this project inclusive to all those that may wish to contribute
also.


## Opening Issues

We classify bugs as any unexpected behaviour that occurs based on the code in the project, and we really appreciate it
when users take the time to [create an issue](https://github.com/stevedomin/swoosh/issues).

Please take time to add as much detail as you can to any bug reports, consider including things like the version of
Elixir you are using, which adapter you are having trouble with and any custom config you have passed for that adapter.

If you are thinking about adding a feature, you should the check Issues first, someone else may have started already,
or it might be a feature we've decided not to implement intentionally.

## Style guidelines

We support the common conventions found in Elixir, if you're in doubt take a look at the code in the project, and we
would like to keep the style consistent throughout.

### General rules

- Keep line length below 120 characters.
- Complex anonymous functions should be extracted into named functions.
- One line functions, should only take up one line!
- Pipes are great, but don't use them, if they are less readable than brackets then drop the pipe!
