Compose, deliver and test your emails easily in Elixir.

We have applied the lessons learned from projects like Plug, Ecto and Phoenix in designing clean and composable APIs,
with clear separation of concerns between modules. Out of the box it comes with adapters for Sendgrid, Mandrill,
Mailgun and Postmark, as well as SMTP.

The complete documentation for Swoosh is located [here](https://hexdocs.pm/swoosh).

## Getting started

```elixir
# In your config/config.exs file
config :sample, Sample.Mailer,
  adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Sendgrid,
  api_key: "SG.x.x"

# In your application code
defmodule Sample.Mailer do
  use Swoosh.Mailer, otp_app: :sample
end

defmodule Sample.UserEmail do
  import Swoosh.Email

  def welcome(user) do
    new
    |> to({user.name, user.email})
    |> from({"Dr B Banner", "hulk@smash.com"})
    |> subject("Hello, Avengers!")
    |> html_body("<h1>Hello #{user.name}</h1>")
    |> text_body("Hello #{user.name}\n")
  end
end

# In an IEx session
Sample.UserEmail.welcome(%{name: "Tony Stark", email: "tony@stark.com"}) |> Sample.Mailer.deliver

# Or in a Phoenix controller
defmodule Sample.UserController do
  use Phoenix.Controller
  alias Sample.UserEmail
  alias Sample.Mailer

  def create(conn, params) do
    user = # create user logic
    UserEmail.welcome(user) |> Mailer.deliver
  end
end

```
## Installation

1. Add swoosh to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:swoosh, "~> 0.2.0"}]
    end
    ```

2. Ensure swoosh is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:swoosh]]
    end
    ```

## Adapters

Swoosh supports the most popular transactional email providers out of the box and also has a SMTP adapter. Below is the
list of the adapters currently included:

Provider   | Swoosh adapter
:----------| :------------------------
SMTP       | Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP
Sendgrid   | Swoosh.Adapters.Sendgrid
Mandrill   | Swoosh.Adapters.Mandrill
Mailgun    | Swoosh.Adapters.Mailgun
Postmark   | Swoosh.Adapters.Postmark

Configure which adapter you want to use by updating your `config/config.exs` file:

```elixir
config :sample, Sample.Mailer,
  adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP
  # adapter config (api keys, etc.)
```

Adding new adapters is super easy and we are definitely looking for contributions on that front. Get in touch if you want
to help!

## Phoenix integration

If you are looking to use Swoosh in your Phoenix project, make sure to check out the
[phoenix_swoosh](https://github.com/swoosh/phoenix_swoosh) project. It contains a set of functions that make it easy to
render the text and HTML bodies using Phoenix views, templates and layouts.

Taking the example from above the "Getting Started" section, your code would look something like this:

```elixir
# web/templates/layout/email.html.eex
<html>
  <head>
    <title><%= @email.subject %></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= render @view_module, @view_template, assigns %>
  </body>
</html>

# web/templates/email/welcome.html.eex
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to Sample, <%= @username %>!</h1>
</div>

# web/emails/user_email.ex
defmodule Sample.UserEmail do
  use Phoenix.Swoosh, view: Sample.EmailView, layout: {Sample.LayoutView, :email}

  def welcome(user) do
    new
    |> to({user.name, user.email})
    |> from({"Dr B Banner", "hulk@smash.com"})
    |> subject("Hello, Avengers!")
    |> render_body("welcome.html", %{username: user.username})
  end
end
```

Feels familiar doesn't it? Head to the [phoenix_swoosh](https://github.com/swoosh/phoenix_swoosh) repo for more details.

## Testing

In your `config/test.exs` file set your mailer's adapter to `Swoosh.Adapters.Test` so that you can use the assertions
provided by Swoosh in `Swoosh.TestAssertions` module.

```elixir
defmodule Sample.UserTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  import Swoosh.TestAssertions

  test "send email on user signup" do
    user = create_user(%{username: "ironman", email: "tony@stark.com"})
    assert_email_sent %Swoosh.Email{to: "tony@stark.com", subject: "Hello, ironman!"}
  end
end
```

## Mailbox preview in the browser

Swoosh ships with a Plug that allows you to preview the emails in the local (in-memory) mailbox. It's particularly
convenient in development when you want to check what your email will look like while testing the various flows of your
application.

For email to reach this mailbox you will need to set your `Mailer` adapter to `Swoosh.Adapters.Local`:

```elixir
# in config/dev.exs
config :sample, Mailer,
  adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Local
```

Then, use the Mix task to start the mailbox preview server

```console
$ mix swoosh.mailbox.server
```

Or in your Phoenix project you can `forward` directly to the plug, like this:

```elixir
# in web/router.ex
if Mix.env == :dev do
  scope "/dev" do
    pipe_through [:browser]

    forward "/mailbox", Plug.Swoosh.MailboxPreview, [base_path: "/dev/mailbox"]
  end
end
```

If you are curious, this is how it looks:
